## About

> [!IMPORTANT]
Issues and pull-requests that are clearly **AI-generated** will be automatically **turned down**. Click [here](https://github.com/AshfordFamily/recvx-decomp/pull/40#issuecomment-4861213243) to read up on our stance in regards to the use of LLMs for contributions.

**recvx-decomp** is a reverse-engineering project for Resident Evil: Code Veronica X which has the goal of reconstructing the source code of the game by decompiling the MIPS in the PS2 ELF back to C. The project currently only works with the US release (**SLUS-20184**), with plans to add support for more regions in the future.

Currently, the engine and gameplay systems are decompiled, as well as the **CRI ADXT (Jan 26th, 2001)** lib employed by the game. Enemy AI and GFX code is still incomplete. Testing is done by repackaging the retail disc with our own compiled ELF using a script, and trying out the results on PCSX2. 

Groundwork has been made for decompiling the Dreamcast and GameCube releases of Code Veronica; see the Resources section on this page for some links. Once the project is completed, there will be many potential uses of the code, including and beyond porting.

## Building

First clone the repository: 
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/AshfordFamily/recvx-decomp.git
```

Next, place your copy of the `SLUS_201.84` file from inside the game disc into the `config` folder. 

For this part of the setup, you can use a dev container (or not):

### Dev Container route

If you're using an IDE that supports dev containers such as Visual Studio Code, you can simply open up the repo as a container (you'll need to have Docker or Podman installed on your machine to use this feature).

### Manual route

Install splat with the following command: 
```
pip install -r config/requirements.txt
```

---

**Follow these instructions after performing the step of one of the two routes above:**

Use this command to setup objdiff:
```
python compile.py --setup
```

Once done, you should see a newly-generated `objdiff.json` project file and a `config/asm` folder.

From now on, to build this project you just need to run the compile script each time:
```
python compile.py
```

Note: if you're using Linux, wibo is needed in order to run `mwccps2.exe`. A small prompt with install steps for it will appear if the script can't find wibo in your path.

You can repackage CVX's disc image with the compiled ELF to see the decompiled code in action. You need to put your ISO dump of the game's DVD on the `iso` folder, and extract its contents there:
```
python mkiso.py -m extract --iso iso/RE_CVX.iso
```

Then repackage the ISO:
```
python mkiso.py -m insert
```

If the process is successful, there should be a new file called `RECVX_NEW.iso` that you'll be able to use to test the project with a PS2 emulator or a modded console.
